# Estimating Home Value
----------------------

## Project Objectives

Construct a model to predict assessed home value for single family properties using regression techniques.

Ask exploratory questions of your data that will help you understand more about the attributes and drivers of home value. Answer questions through charts and statistical tests.

Make recommendations to a data science team about how to improve predictions.

Record and share: work done, why, goals, findings, your methodologies, and your conclusions.

Create modules taht will make the proscess repeateable and the report easier to read and follow

Document code, process, findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook Final Report.
